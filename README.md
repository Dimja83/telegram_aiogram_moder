# Telegram-aiogram-bot
### Created on Python(v3.11.0), using the library - aiogram. My beginner project.

The Bot has 5 commands: 
**/ban, /unban, /mute(for time), /unmute, /report.**
_Commands must reply to user messages._

To start bot you need:
1. install the aiogram - pip install aiogram or pip3 install aiogram (if you use Python3)
2. change the config file to your settings.(bot ID, group ID, admin ID, can use IDBot and BotFather)
3. run the code or deploy somewhere(i prefer to Heruko, it's free)
